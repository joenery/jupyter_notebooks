def read_library_package_data(file_path, **kwargs):
    """
    Reads a CSV file containing library package data into a pandas DataFrame.

    Parameters:
    - file_path (str): The path to the CSV file containing library package data to be read.
    - **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to be passed to pandas.read_csv function.
        This allows for customization such as specifying separators, column names,
        data types, handling missing values, and more.

    Returns:
    - pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the library package data read from the CSV file.

    Example usage:
    >>> df = read_library_package_data('path/to/library_package_data.csv', sep=',', header=0)
    >>> print(df.head())

    This example reads a CSV file with a comma as the separator and the first row as headers,
    which is typical for CSV files containing library package data. Adjust the `kwargs` according
    to your CSV file's specific format and requirements.

def plot_library_pools_by_date(data):
    """
    Plots a bar chart showing the total number of library pools by shipping date.

    Parameters:
    - data (pd.DataFrame): A pandas DataFrame containing at least two columns:
        'Shipping Date' with dates in datetime format, and
        'Library Pool Count' representing the count of library pools for each record.

    The function aggregates the library pool counts by shipping date, formats the dates,
    and plots a bar chart. Shipping dates are displayed on the x-axis,
    and the total number of library pools is displayed on the y-axis.

    Note: Ensure 'Shipping Date' is in datetime format and 'Library Pool Count' is correctly calculated
    before calling this function.

    Integrates reading library package data from a CSV file and plotting the total number of library pools by shipping date.

    - **read_csv_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the pandas.read_csv function.

    This function first reads the specified CSV file to create a DataFrame. It then processes this DataFrame to count the
    number of library pools per shipping date and plots these counts as a bar chart, providing a visual representation of
    library pool distribution over time.

    Example usage:
